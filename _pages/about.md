I am an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University and a research assistant in the [Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtq-policy-lab/). Last summer, I attended the [AEA Summer Program](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/AEASP) and in summer 2023 I will be joining the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as an Economic Research Intern.

I study health and public economics, with a focus on LGBTQ populations. My research has specifically examined health risk and access disparities, youth homelessness, intergenerational mobility, and the effects of health policies on same-sex households. My work has appeared in *Economics Letters*, *JAMA*, and *JAMA Pediatrics*.
