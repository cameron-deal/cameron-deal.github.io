I am an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University and a research assistant in the [Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtq-policy-lab/). In Summer 2022, I attended the [AEA Summer Program](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/AEASP) and in Summer 2023, I was a Microeconomics Research Intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

I study health economics and economic history, with a focus on LGBTQ populations and inequality. My research has specifically examined health risk and access disparities, youth homelessness, intergenerational mobility, and the effects of health policies on same-sex households. More recently, I've been working on projects related to interracial marriage in historical settings in the United States.
