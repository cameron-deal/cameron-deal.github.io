I am a PhD student at Harvard's [Business Economics PhD Program](https://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/phd-programs/business-economics/Pages/default.aspx). I completed my undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University and was a research assistant in the [Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtq-policy-lab/). I am an alum of the [AEA Summer Program](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/AEASP) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

I study health and labor economics, with a focus on LGBTQ populations and inequality. My research has specifically examined health risk and access disparities, youth homelessness, intergenerational mobility, and the effects of health policies on same-sex households. More recently, I've been working on projects related to interracial marriage in historical settings in the United States.
