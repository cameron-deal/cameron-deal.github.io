I am an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University and a research assistant in the [Vanderbilt LGBTQ+ Policy Lab]{https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lgbtq-policy-lab/}.

I study health and public economics, with a focus on LGBTQ populations. My research has specifically examined health risk and access disparities, youth homelessness, intergenerational mobility, and the effects of health policies on same-sex households. My work has appeared in *JAMA Pediatrics*, *JAMA*, and *Economics Letters*.
